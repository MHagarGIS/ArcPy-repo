# ArcPy-repo contains ArcPy scripts that can be used within ArcMap, ArcGIS Pro, or as standalone scripts to perform a variety of tasks.
# Proper use of each script will be designated in the header.

Over the course of the past several years I have created a small assortment of ArcPy scripts for use within ArcMap, ArcGIS Pro, or as standalone scripts.
A context for each script will be provided along with descriptions of any functions.
